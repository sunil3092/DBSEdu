Question 2
* Consider a continuous attribute in your dataset as the target variable, perform
 regression analysis using different ensemble methods, visualize and interpret the results. 

Question 3

Use dataset available on http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/data/nfl2008_fga.csv

* Use LDA to classify the dataset into few classes so that at least 90% of information of dataset is explained through new classification. (Hint: model the variable “qtr” to variables “togo”, “kicker”, and “ydline”). How many LDs do you choose? Explain the reason.
* Apply PCA, and identify the important principle components involving at least 90% of dataset variation. Explain your decision strategy?  Plot principle components versus their variance.
