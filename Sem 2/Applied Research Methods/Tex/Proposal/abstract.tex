\section*{Abstract}
\footnotesize BPO Industry's use many software measures to make sure when a customer calls to solve their grievances may that be an IVR call or the customer assistant attending at the other end a resultant feedback is achieved but  the feed back collection for customer satisfaction is a complicated and expensive process and often depends on the willingness of the customer to provide the data. Using AI and modern audio processing techniques we can collect the satisfaction level from the customer in the call itself. Analysing the various pitch and tone we can identify the various aspects of speech which can indicate weather the customer is neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised with this data collected and processed either from the live audio or recorded audio we can setup a seem less customer satisfaction pipeline and boost business growth.    \par \\
